		"Description": "This is the method by which most payment cards calculate your payment due. An average daily balance is determined by adding each day's balance and then dividing that total by the number of days in a billing cycle. The average daily balance is then multiplied by a card's monthly periodic rate, which is calculated by dividing the annual percentage rate by 12. A card with an annual rate of 18 percent would have a monthly periodic rate of 1.5 percent. If that card had a $500 average daily balance it would yield a monthly finance charge of $7.50.\n\nAverage Daily Balance computes your interest rate based on an average of each day's balance in a month. Say you buy $200 of stuff on January 15. To figure out your bill, add together all the daily balances of the billing cycle and dividing the sum total by the number of days within that cycle.\n\nSo, January 1 - 14, you had a daily balance of $0. \nJanuary 15 - 31, you had a balance of $200. \nFor 16 days, you had a balance of $200, or a total balance of $3,200. \nDivide this by 31, the number of days in January. \nYour average daily balance is: $103.23 \nThe formula for computing your overall interest is as follows:\n\n(Average Daily Balance x Annual Percentage Rate (APR) x Number of Days in Billing Cycle) / 365\n\nSo, if you're in your introductory period of 5.99%, your interest (also called a finance charge) is:\n\n$103.23 + (($103.23 x 5.99% x 31)/365) = $103.76 = the money you owe\n\nThus, next month, assuming you buy nothing, your loan amount owed will be $103.76.",
