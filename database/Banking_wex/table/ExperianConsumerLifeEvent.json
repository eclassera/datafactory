		"Description": "Major events that may affect the credit of the associated Customer as defined and reported by Experian.\n\nCredit and major life events\n\nBig changes in your life can often mean the same for your credit situation. A change in your marital status will likely alter your credit profile, and so will opening a small business. New college students have important credit issues to consider, and new immigrants to the United States need to learn how credit works. \n\nMarriage or divorce: Dealing with joint credit accounts can add to the headaches and heartbreak of divorce. But there are a number of steps you can take right now to avoid many hassles down the road. Keep in mind that a divorce decree alone has no impact whatsoever on your joint accounts - including credit cards, car loans, home mortgages and lines of credit. Why? Joint accounts mean joint liability. When you obtained a joint credit account, you and your spouse agreed you would both be responsible for paying the bills. In other words, you're both responsible for the debt you incurred during the marriage. And if one of you defaults, creditors will pursue the other.  \n\nDeath of a spouse: If you've lost a spouse, you're already going through one of the most emotionally draining experiences possible. When a loved one dies, there are also numerous financial matters to deal with, including credit and debt issues. There are, however, some simple steps you can take now to help down the road. \n\nStabilizing your credit in the event of a death can be difficult, especially if your spouse held all of the credit in his or her name. Keep in mind that in community property states, credit accounts opened during marriage are automatically joint. That means you are still responsible for any debt that your deceased spouse incurred. \n\nBy law, a creditor cannot automatically close a joint account or change the terms because of the death of one spouse. Generally, the creditor will ask the survivor to file a new credit application in his or her own name. After reviewing the new information, the creditor will then decide to continue to extend credit or alter the credit limit. You might want to open a new credit account in your name. In doing so, keep in mind that you must use your name only when applying. Including your deceased spouse's name will result in a joint account. \n\nOpening a small business: The success of a new small business largely depends on the creditworthiness of its owner. Whether the office needs more equipment or the employees need more training, it's the owner's responsibility to foot the bill. \n\nSome owners turn to investors for the capital, but many others will secure a loan or a line of credit from a bank. Others simply use their own personal credit cards or a combination of these types of credit. Savvy small business owners will try to find lower interest rates on small business loans rather than the increased cost of using a personal credit card. \n\nUnlike the unsecured credit cards, small business loans generally need to be secured by assets, namely property or goods. You'll also need to calculate the actual cost of the loan, and decide if you're comfortable living with some of the imposed restrictions (such as caps on your salary). \n\nTo secure a loan, you will probably need to submit a precise business plan, tax returns, balance sheets, income statements and credit history - as well as additional documentation - to the loan officials. Considering the fact that about 80 percent of new businesses collapse within three years, it's easy to see why lenders are reluctant to finance new businesses. If securing a bank loan is indeed not a possibility for you and your business, you can always turn to the plastic to finance your entrepreneurial dreams. \n\nNew college student: As high school graduation and the responsibilities of the real world loom near, it may be a good time to start thinking about establishing your own credit history. Establishing credit before you graduate puts you in a much better position once you join the working world and need to make major purchases.\n\nChances are you've already been contacted by various lenders offering all kinds of credit cards. Ever on the lookout for new customers headed for professional careers, creditors know that many students will be long term customers, and they are eager to forge relationships with students early on. \n\nStudent credit card offers often include promotional specials, such as free gifts or low introductory interest rates. Take your time and carefully review all of your credit choices before submitting a credit application. Pay attention to the fine print, too. Late fees, cash advance fees and annual fees can be significant. \n\nNew to America: Whether born in America or a newcomer to the land of opportunity, we're all looking for ways to fulfill the American Dream. But one thing's for certain: without good credit, the dream may be hard to reach.\n\nFor anyone in pursuit of life, liberty and happiness, credit is a fundamental prerequisite, especially when it comes to buying a car or home. This is why new residents of America need to begin establishing creditworthiness as soon as they settle in and find employment.\n\nUnfortunately, getting credit is not always easy. Many U.S. creditors may be wary of lending to newcomers, who may return to their homeland and leave their debt behind. \n\nNevertheless, if you're planning to live permanently in America, you're eventually going to need credit, probably sooner rather than later. The easiest way to establish credit is by setting up a checking account at a bank and obtaining a secured credit card. The bank faces no financial risk because these cards are backed by your own money (typically $500, which earns no interest). Once you demonstrate that you pay your bills responsibly each month, the bank most likely will increase your credit limit and offer you a non-secured card. \n\nThere are some pitfalls to secured cards. Beware of scams that ask for up-front fees or have most of the balance charged to the card as security. Unless the issuer of the secured card reports your payment history to the credit bureaus, a secured card is useless for establishing a credit history. Interest rates can also be very high on secured cards. \n\nIf you belong to a credit union, you can deposit money in an account and then take out a loan. Because they are non-profit institutions that serve specific groups of people, credit unions often have more flexible lending guidelines than commercial banks.",
