Whether you're looking to get a mortgage, car loan or home-equity loan, you're going to get scored. \n\nNamed after Fair Isaac Corp., the firm that developed the scoring model used by the three major credit bureaus -- Equifax, Experian and Trans Union -- your FICO score is calculated using a computer model that compares the information in your credit report to what's on the credit reports of thousands of other customers. \nFICO scores range from about 300 to 900. Generally, the higher the score, the lower the credit risk. It's very difficult to say what's a \"good\" or \"bad\" score, though, since lenders have different standards for how much risk they will accept. \n\nA credit score that one lender considers satisfactory may be regarded as unsatisfactory by other lenders for comparable credit instruments.\n\nScores also fluctuate depending on credit activity. Since credit bureaus only calculate your score at the lender's request, it will be based on the information in your file at that particular credit bureau, at that particular time only.\nThe Fair, Isaac model takes into account five factors when evaluating your credit worthiness.\n\nPast payment history \nAbout 35 percent of your FICO score is based on this, which includes late payments, delinquencies and bankruptcies. The fewer the late payments, the better your score -- though a recent late payment hurts your score more than one from five years ago.\n\nOutstanding debt\nAbout 30 percent of your FICO score, this includes what you owe on your credit cards and how much you owe on installment loans, compared with the original amounts of the loans.  \nHow long you've had credit \nHow long you've had accounts and how often you use them, this accounts for about 15 percent of your FICO score.\n\nNew applications for credit \nResearch shows that opening several credit accounts in a short period does represent greater risk, especially for people who do not have long-established credit history. This makes up about 10 percent of your FICO score. \n\nTypes of credit \nMaking up about another 10 percent of your FICO score, this includes credit cards and loans, including installment and mortgage loans.\nBear in mind, however, that U.S. law forbids personal information such as ethnicity, religion, sex or marital status from being reflected in your FICO score.\n\nThe main benefit of credit scoring, lenders argue, is that an automated system allows for faster decisions. Keep in mind, too, that a credit bureau score isn't the only factor lenders take into account when considering your loan application.",
