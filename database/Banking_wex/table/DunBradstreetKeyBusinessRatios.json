			"Description": "Measures the relationship between financial values in a company's balance sheet and income statement. The ratios offer a way to evaluate the performance and stability of a business when you're looking to set credit limits and lending terms for new and existing accounts, assess key suppliers, perform competitive analysis, or research the financial standing of a potential business partner or acquisition candidate.\n\nIndustry Norms for these ratios provide a side-by-side comparison of a business with it's industry peers. These norms can help you spot important trends, identify strengths and weaknesses, or serve as a benchmark for evaluating company risk. Industry Norms are based on the SIC code of the company you are inquiring on, as well as the firm's geographic location and total asset size, when available. They represent median statistics derived from D&B's financial statement database of public and private companies, which is updated on a quarterly basis.",
