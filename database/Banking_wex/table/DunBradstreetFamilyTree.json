		"Description": "As companies today rapidly grow and change, it's more important than ever to understand how an organization is structured. D&B's Family Tree allows you to more easily view and assess risk across different parts of an organization by showing the linkage relationship between different companies within a corporate family.\n\nLinkage is reflected in D&B's database when one business entity has financial or legal responsibility for and control over another, creating a Headquarters/Branch or Parent/Subsidiary relationship. Linkage is updated monthly and reflects mergers, acquisitions, openings, and closings.\n\nThe following family members are shown in D&B's database:\n\nParent: a corporation that owns more than 50% of another corporation. A parent can also be a headquarters if it owns branches.\n\nHeadquarters: a family member that has branches or divisions reporting to it and is financially responsible for those branches or divisions. If headquarters is more than 50% owned by another corporation, it will also be a subsidiary. If it owns more than 50% of another corporation, then it is also a parent.\n\nDomestic Ultimate: a subsidiary within the global family tree that is the highest-ranking member within a specific country.\n\nGlobal Ultimate: the top most responsible entity within the corporate family tree.\n\nBranch: a secondary location of a company's headquarters. It has no legal responsibility for its debts, even though bills may be paid from the branch location.\n\nSubsidiary: a corporation that is more than 50% owned by another corporation and will have a different legal business name from its parent company. There are also single location subsidiaries where the subsidiary does not have anything reporting to it.\n\nDivision: like a branch, it is a secondary location of a business. A division carries out specific business operations related to the headquarters under a divisional name. Divisions look similar to branches in D&B WorldBase and carry a branch code.\n\nAffiliates: companies that are related to a business through common ownership by the direct parent company. All of them share the same parent company. A direct parent company is a corporation that owns more than 50% of another corporation's capital stock.",
