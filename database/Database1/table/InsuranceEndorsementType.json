		"Description": "A specific type of amendment to your policy written especially to cover unique items just for you. An endorsement is also a change to your policy that is made during the policy's term. \n\nAn endorsement is attached to your policy to modify the terms of the insurance contract.\n\nBoat Ex:\n- Charter Endorsement\n- Yacht Racing Endorsement\n\nCondominium Ex:\n- Earthquake Endorsement\n- Home Business Endorsement\n- Inflation Guard Endorsement\n- Personal Injury Endorsement\n- Personal Property Replacement Cost Endorsement\n- Personal Property Replacement Cost Endorsement\n- Scheduled Personal Property Endorsement\n\nWhere:\n\nEARTHQUAKE ENDORSEMENT\nThe earthquake endorsement covers not only earthquakes, but volcanic eruptions, landslides or any other type of earth movement. A single earthquake is defined as all shocks occurring within a 72 hour period. The earthquake endorsement has a percentage deductible equal to 5% of the coverage for the main residence, with a minimum deductible of $250. Higher deductibles can be chosen to reduce the cost of the premium. However, in states with a relatively high frequency of earthquakes, such as California, the percentage deductible can range from 10% to 25%.\n \nHOME BUSINESS ENDORSEMENT\nMany people operate a business from their home. The standard policy has a limit of $2,500 for business property and legal liability for the business is specifically excluded. The home business endorsement increases the coverage for property damage to the limits of Coverage C of the homeowners policy, which is 50% of the coverage for the main residence, and includes coverage for accounts receivable, records, and lost income and extra expenses when the business must be suspended because of a covered loss. Coverage for business property located outside of the home is increased from $500 to $5,000.\n\nThe liability coverage includes bodily injury, property damage, and personal injury. Note, however, that it does include professional liability. Thus, if a lawyer worked from a home office, he would still have to purchase malpractice insurance for malpractice claims.\n\nINFLATION GUARD ENDORSEMENT\nGenerally, if a home is not insured for at least 80% of its value, a coinsurance penalty will be applied, so the insured will receive less than the replacement cost if there is a loss. To prevent this, the homeowner can purchase an inflation guard endorsement, where the amount of the insurance is increased pro rata annually by an amount that the homeowner chooses-usually 4% or 6%. For instance, if a home is insured for $100,000 and the insured chooses a 4% rate of increase, then if the insured suffers a complete loss in 6 months, the insurance will pay $102,000; if the loss occurs 9 months later, then the payment will be for $103,000; and if the loss occurs a full year later, the payment will be the full 4% annual increase?$104,000. \nBecause the coverages for other structures, personal property, and loss of use are a percentage of Coverage A, which insures the main residence, this increase in coverage also applies to those sections. For instance, since the limits for personal property is 50% of the main coverage, the policy limit for personal property in the above example would be $50,000, which would increase to $52,000 (4%) at the end of the 1st year.\n\nPERSONAL INJURY ENDORSEMENT\nAlthough the standard homeowners policy covers bodily injury and property damage, it does not cover personal injury, which includes false arrest, wrongful eviction or entry, invasion of the right of privacy in a room or dwelling, slander and defamation, or the violation of the person's right to privacy-in other words, injuries that don't affect the body. The personal injury endorsement covers the liability that arises from a personal injury.\n\nPERSONAL PROPERTY REPLACEMENT COST ENDORSEMENT\nThe standard homeowners policy pays actual cash value for damaged or stolen personal property. Because of depreciation, actual cash value is almost always significantly less than replacement cost. To remedy this, the homeowner can purchase the personal property replacement cost endorsement, which will usually pay the replacement or repair cost without any deduction for depreciation. However, it does not apply to scheduled personal property, which has a separate endorsement, and the actual payment from this endorsement is the least of the following: repair cost, replacement cost, total limits for personal property, or the limit for a particular item.\n\nIf the amount exceeds $500, then the item must be either be repaired or replaced. Besides scheduled property, other excluded property includes property in poor condition and stored property that is little used.\n\nSCHEDULED PERSONAL PROPERTY ENDORSEMENT\nThere is some personal property, such as jewelry or musical instruments, that have low coverage limits compared to what they may be worth, because most people don't have such property so they shouldn't have to pay the premium for it, and because it is difficult to verify the value of such items.\nHowever, the homeowner can purchase a scheduled personal property endorsement that covers specified property for a specified value that is agreeable to the insurer. Generally, this is an open risks policy that pays for any direct loss, unless it is specifically excluded. The payout is equal to the agreed value loss settlement, which is the amount that the insurer agreed to pay in the event of a complete loss. Thus, if jewelry that was stolen was insured for $10,000, the insurer will pay the insured $10,000. There is no deduction for depreciation and no deductible.\n\nEarthquake Ex:\n- Building Code Upgrade\n- Loss of Use\n\nFlood Ex:\n- Payment Prior To Flood Endorsement\n \nWhere:\n\nPAYMENT PRIOR TO FLOOD ENDORSEMENT\nThe purpose of the endorsement is to help people move buildings that are going to be flooded before the rising waters make it impossible to do so. If insurance appraisers rule a building is in \"imminent danger\" of being flooded, the endorsement allows 60 percent of the value of the policy to be paid in advance. The owner must use the money to buy the building at salvage value and move it above 1460 feet. The owner can use the land for agricultural or recreational purposes, and provides a conservation easement to the local government, tribe, or a non-profit trust. Once the owner has moved the building outside the floodplain, the remaining 40 percent of the policy will be paid.\n\nHomeowners Ex:\n- Earthquake Endorsement\n- Home Business Endorsement\n- Inflation Guard Endorsement\n- Personal Injury Endorsement\n- Personal Property Replacement Cost Endorsement\n- Personal Property Replacement Cost Endorsement\n- Scheduled Personal Property Endorsement\n\nWhere:\n\nEARTHQUAKE ENDORSEMENT\nThe earthquake endorsement covers not only earthquakes, but volcanic eruptions, landslides or any other type of earth movement.

Actual cash value takes depreciation into consideration when calculating a post-claim payout, which means you may not get enough to buy a new version of the item that was lost. This is where replacement cost coverage can help.\n\nSCHEDULED PERSONAL PROPERTY\n- This is additional insurance for high value items or special collections. Common examples include jewelry, coin collections, sporting goods, specialized electronics, and other valuables.\n\nVehicle Ex:\n- Road Service\n\nWorkers' Compensation Ex:\n- Catastrophic Industrial Accidents\n- Domestic Terrorism\n- Foreign Terrorism\n- Premium Due Date\n- Workers Compensation Broad Form\n\nLife Ex:\nACCELERATED BENEFITS RIDER\nAccelerated benefits riders  allow the early payment of portions of the policy face amount should the insured suffer from a terminal illness or injury.\n\nAccelerated payments can be made in a lump sum or in monthly installments over a specified period.\n\nACCIDENTAL DEATH BENEFIT RIDER\nAccidental death benefits are sometimes called 'double indemnity' provisions. They provide an additional amount of insurance, usually some multiple of the face amount of the base policy, if death occurs under defined conditions.\n\nAUTOMATIC PREMIUM LOAN RIDER\nAutomatic Premium Loan Riders are normally a standard feature of life insurance policies or available at no additional charge. This rider allows the insurer to pay premiums from the policy's cash value if the premiums have not been paid by the end of the grace period. These deductions from cash values are treated as loans and are charged interest.\n\nIf the loan is not repaid the interest will then also be deducted from the cash value.  \n\nIf the insured dies, the loan plus interest will be deducted from the benefits payable.\n\nAn automatic premium loan option can be elected at the time of application or normally added after the policy is issued.\n\nCOST OF LIVING RIDER\nThe Cost of Living Rider provides increases in the amount of insurance protection without requiring the insured to provide evidence of insurability. This granted increase is tied to an inflation index such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nGUARANTEED INSURABILITY RIDER\nThe Guaranteed Insurability rider may be attached to the insurance policy at the time of purchase. This rider allows the insured to buy specified amounts of additional insurance without evidence of insurability at specified intervals in the future.\n\nOTHER INSUREDS RIDER\nThe Other Insureds Rider provide insurance coverage for more than one family member.\n\nThis rider is often offered as a term rider covering a family member other than the insured.\n\nPAYOR RIDER\nThe payor rider provides for a waiver of premiums if the premium-payor should die or become totally disabled.\n\nVIATICAL RIDER\nIndividuals with terminal illness or severe chronic illness may sell their life insurance policies to viatical companies.\n\nViatical companies purchase a policy from 50-80% of the policy face value and become responsible for paying premiums. The company receives the death benefit when the insured dies.\n\nWAIVER OF PREMIUM RIDER\nThe Waiver Of Premium Rider provides added security by preventing a policy from lapsing for nonpayment of premiums which the insurer is unable to work or is disabled.",

			"Description": "A specific type of amendment to your policy written especially to cover unique items just for you. An endorsement is also a change to your policy that is made during the policy's term. \n\nAn endorsement is attached to your policy to modify the terms of the insurance contract.\n\nBoat Ex:\n- Charter Endorsement\n- Yacht Racing Endorsement\n\nCondominium Ex:\n- Earthquake Endorsement\n- Home Business Endorsement\n- Inflation Guard Endorsement\n- Personal Injury Endorsement\n- Personal Property Replacement Cost Endorsement\n- Personal Property Replacement Cost Endorsement\n- Scheduled Personal Property Endorsement\n\nWhere:\n\nEARTHQUAKE ENDORSEMENT\nThe earthquake endorsement covers not only earthquakes, but volcanic eruptions, landslides or any other type of earth movement. A single earthquake is defined as all shocks occurring within a 72 hour period. The earthquake endorsement has a percentage deductible equal to 5% of the coverage for the main residence, with a minimum deductible of $250. Higher deductibles can be chosen to reduce the cost of the premium. However, in states with a relatively high frequency of earthquakes, such as California, the percentage deductible can range from 10% to 25%.\n \nHOME BUSINESS ENDORSEMENT\nMany people operate a business from their home. The standard policy has a limit of $2,500 for business property and legal liability for the business is specifically excluded. The home business endorsement increases the coverage for property damage to the limits of Coverage C of the homeowners policy, which is 50% of the coverage for the main residence, and includes coverage for accounts receivable, records, and lost income and extra expenses when the business must be suspended because of a covered loss. Coverage for business property located outside of the home is increased from $500 to $5,000.\n\nThe liability coverage includes bodily injury, property damage, and personal injury. Note, however, that it does include professional liability. Thus, if a lawyer worked from a home office, he would still have to purchase malpractice insurance for malpractice claims.\n\nINFLATION GUARD ENDORSEMENT\nGenerally, if a home is not insured for at least 80% of its value, a coinsurance penalty will be applied, so the insured will receive less than the replacement cost if there is a loss. To prevent this, the homeowner can purchase an inflation guard endorsement, where the amount of the insurance is increased pro rata annually by an amount that the homeowner chooses-usually 4% or 6%. For instance, if a home is insured for $100,000 and the insured chooses a 4% rate of increase, then if the insured suffers a complete loss in 6 months, the insurance will pay $102,000; if the loss occurs 9 months later, then the payment will be for $103,000; and if the loss occurs a full year later, the payment will be the full 4% annual increase?$104,000. \nBecause the coverages for other structures, personal property, and loss of use are a percentage of Coverage A, which insures the main residence, this increase in coverage also applies to those sections. For instance, since the limits for personal property is 50% of the main coverage, the policy limit for personal property in the above example would be $50,000, which would increase to $52,000 (4%) at the end of the 1st year.\n\nPERSONAL INJURY ENDORSEMENT\nAlthough the standard homeowners policy covers bodily injury and property damage, it does not cover personal injury, which includes false arrest, wrongful eviction or entry, invasion of the right of privacy in a room or dwelling, slander and defamation, or the violation of the person's right to privacy-in other words, injuries that don't affect the body. The personal injury endorsement covers the liability that arises from a personal injury.\n\nPERSONAL PROPERTY REPLACEMENT COST ENDORSEMENT\nThe standard homeowners policy pays actual cash value for damaged or stolen personal property. Because of depreciation, actual cash value is almost always significantly less than replacement cost. To remedy this, the homeowner can purchase the personal property replacement cost endorsement, which will usually pay the replacement or repair cost without any deduction for depreciation. However, it does not apply to scheduled personal property, which has a separate endorsement, and the actual payment from this endorsement is the least of the following: repair cost, replacement cost, total limits for personal property, or the limit for a particular item.\n\nIf the amount exceeds $500, then the item must be either be repaired or replaced. Besides scheduled property, other excluded property includes property in poor condition and stored property that is little used.\n\nSCHEDULED PERSONAL PROPERTY ENDORSEMENT\nThere is some personal property, such as jewelry or musical instruments, that have low coverage limits compared to what they may be worth, because most people don't have such property so they shouldn't have to pay the premium for it, and because it is difficult to verify the value of such items.\nHowever, the homeowner can purchase a scheduled personal property endorsement that covers specified property for a specified value that is agreeable to the insurer. Generally, this is an open risks policy that pays for any direct loss, unless it is specifically excluded. The payout is equal to the agreed value loss settlement, which is the amount that the insurer agreed to pay in the event of a complete loss. Thus, if jewelry that was stolen was insured for $10,000, the insurer will pay the insured $10,000. There is no deduction for depreciation and no deductible.\n\nEarthquake Ex:\n- Building Code Upgrade\n- Loss of Use\n\nFlood Ex:\n- Payment Prior To Flood Endorsement\n \nWhere:\n\nPAYMENT PRIOR TO FLOOD ENDORSEMENT\nThe purpose of the endorsement is to help people move buildings that are going to be flooded before the rising waters make it impossible to do so. If insurance appraisers rule a building is in \"imminent danger\" of being flooded, the endorsement allows 60 percent of the value of the policy to be paid in advance. The owner must use the money to buy the building at salvage value and move it above 1460 feet. The owner can use the land for agricultural or recreational purposes, and provides a conservation easement to the local government, tribe, or a non-profit trust. Once the owner has moved the building outside the floodplain, the remaining 40 percent of the policy will be paid.\n\nHomeowners Ex:\n- Earthquake Endorsement\n- Home Business Endorsement\n- Inflation Guard Endorsement\n- Personal Injury Endorsement\n- Personal Property Replacement Cost Endorsement\n- Personal Property Replacement Cost Endorsement\n- Scheduled Personal Property Endorsement\n\nWhere:\n\nEARTHQUAKE ENDORSEMENT\nThe earthquake endorsement covers not only earthquakes, but volcanic eruptions, landslides or any other type of earth movement.

Actual cash value takes depreciation into consideration when calculating a post-claim payout, which means you may not get enough to buy a new version of the item that was lost. This is where replacement cost coverage can help.\n\nSCHEDULED PERSONAL PROPERTY\n- This is additional insurance for high value items or special collections. Common examples include jewelry, coin collections, sporting goods, specialized electronics, and other valuables.\n\nVehicle Ex:\n- Road Service\n\nWorkers' Compensation Ex:\n- Catastrophic Industrial Accidents\n- Domestic Terrorism\n- Foreign Terrorism\n- Premium Due Date\n- Workers Compensation Broad Form\n\nLife Ex:\nACCELERATED BENEFITS RIDER\nAccelerated benefits riders  allow the early payment of portions of the policy face amount should the insured suffer from a terminal illness or injury.\n\nAccelerated payments can be made in a lump sum or in monthly installments over a specified period.\n\nACCIDENTAL DEATH BENEFIT RIDER\nAccidental death benefits are sometimes called 'double indemnity' provisions. They provide an additional amount of insurance, usually some multiple of the face amount of the base policy, if death occurs under defined conditions.\n\nAUTOMATIC PREMIUM LOAN RIDER\nAutomatic Premium Loan Riders are normally a standard feature of life insurance policies or available at no additional charge. This rider allows the insurer to pay premiums from the policy's cash value if the premiums have not been paid by the end of the grace period. These deductions from cash values are treated as loans and are charged interest.\n\nIf the loan is not repaid the interest will then also be deducted from the cash value.  \n\nIf the insured dies, the loan plus interest will be deducted from the benefits payable.\n\nAn automatic premium loan option can be elected at the time of application or normally added after the policy is issued.\n\nCOST OF LIVING RIDER\nThe Cost of Living Rider provides increases in the amount of insurance protection without requiring the insured to provide evidence of insurability. This granted increase is tied to an inflation index such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nGUARANTEED INSURABILITY RIDER\nThe Guaranteed Insurability rider may be attached to the insurance policy at the time of purchase. This rider allows the insured to buy specified amounts of additional insurance without evidence of insurability at specified intervals in the future.\n\nOTHER INSUREDS RIDER\nThe Other Insureds Rider provide insurance coverage for more than one family member.\n\nThis rider is often offered as a term rider covering a family member other than the insured.\n\nPAYOR RIDER\nThe payor rider provides for a waiver of premiums if the premium-payor should die or become totally disabled.\n\nVIATICAL RIDER\nIndividuals with terminal illness or severe chronic illness may sell their life insurance policies to viatical companies.\n\nViatical companies purchase a policy from 50-80% of the policy face value and become responsible for paying premiums. The company receives the death benefit when the insured dies.\n\nWAIVER OF PREMIUM RIDER\nThe Waiver Of Premium Rider provides added security by preventing a policy from lapsing for nonpayment of premiums which the insurer is unable to work or is disabled.",
