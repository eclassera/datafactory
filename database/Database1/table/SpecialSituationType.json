It permits an insurer to pay all or a portion of the proceeds to someone who is not named in the policy but has a valid right to the proceeds such as:\n\n-  a named beneficiary who is a minor\n-  a deceased named beneficiary\n-  when no claim is submitted with a specific period of time\n-  when costs are incurred by another party for the deceased insured's final medical expenses or funeral expenses\n\nSIMULTANEOUS DEATH\nThe uniform Simultaneous Death Act has been enacted in most states to address what happens if the primary beneficiary and the insured both die in the same accident and there is no evidence to show which one died first.\n\nThis act indicates that policy proceeds are to be distributed as if the insured died last.    This allows the insurance company to pay proceeds to a secondary or other contingent beneficiary.    If no contingent beneficiary has been named, the insured's estate will receive the proceeds.\n\nSPENDTHRIFT CLAUSE\nThe Spendthrift Clause is a commonly used clause in life insurance policies whose purpose is to protect beneficiaries from the claims of creditors.\n\nIt shelters life insurance proceeds that have not yet been paid to a named beneficiary from the claims of either the beneficiary's or policyowners creditors.\n\nThe Spendthrift Clause does not apply to proceeds paid in one lump sum.    It does apply to installment payment arrangements.\n  \nGenerally the clause states that policy distributions payable to the beneficiary after the insured dies are not assignable or transferrable and may not be attached in any way.\n\nThe Spendthrift trust clause does not protect the proceeds that belong to the policyowner and are payable as income to the policyowner.   It does protect only money held in trust by the insurance company that is intended to be paid to the named beneficiary at some future time.   \n\nSpendthrift clauses are valid in the majority of states.",
