		"Description": "The Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) is a hierarchical classification with four levels, namely Divisions (the broadest level), Subdivisions, Groups and Classes (the finest level). At the Divisional level, the main purpose is to provide a limited number of categories which provide a broad overall picture of the economy and are suitable for the publication of summary tables in official statistics. The Subdivision, Group and Class levels provide increasingly detailed dissections of these categories for the compilation of more specific and detailed statistics.\n\nANZSIC is widely used by government agencies, industry organizations and researchers for various administrative, regulatory, taxation and research purposes throughout Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAt each level of the classification, a unit can be classified to only one category.\n\nUsing the top-down method, units are first classified to a division, then to a subdivision within that division, and so on until the unit is finally classified to a class.\n\nThe new divisional structure for ANZSIC 2006 is as follows:\n\nCode - Title\n------------------------------------------------------------\nA - Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing\nB - Mining\nC - Manufacturing\nD - Electricity, Gas, Water and Waste Services\nE - Construction\nF - Wholesale Trade\nG - Retail Trade\nH - Accommodation and Food Services\nI - Transport, Postal and Warehousing\nJ - Information Media and Telecommunications\nK - Financial and Insurance Services\nL - Rental, Hiring and Real Estate Services\nM - Professional, Scientific and Technical Services\nN - Administrative and Support Services\nO - Public Administration and Safety\nP - Education and Training\nQ - Health Care and Social Assistance\nR - Arts and Recreation Services\nS - Other Services\n\nSource:  http://siccode.com/en/pages/what-is-an-anzsic-code",
