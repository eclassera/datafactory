In an automobile accident, it comprises bodily injuries sustained by each person. When Bodily Injury is purchased in split limits, the first limit is the \"per person\" limit: e.g. $100,000(per person)/$300,000(per occurrence)\n\nEACH OCCURRENCE / PER OCCURRENCE\nThis refers to the cap amount an insurance company will pay for all claims arising from a single incident. In an automobile accident, it comprises bodily injuries sustained by all parties. When Bodily Injury coverage is purchased in split limits, the second limit is the \"per occurrence\" limit: e.g. $100,000(per person)/$300,000(per occurrence)\n\nSPLIT LIMIT / MAXIMUM\nSPLIT LIMIT / PER ACCIDENT\nSPLIT LIMIT / PER OCCURRENCE\nAny insurance coverage with separately stated limits for different types of coverage. Example: an automobile liability policy of 100/300/50 provides a maximum of $100,000 bodily injury coverage per person, $300,000 bodily injury coverage per accident, and a property damage limit of $50,000 per accident.\n\nCOMBINED SINGLE LIMIT\nBodily Injury and Property Damage coverage expressed as one single amount of coverage\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE\nCovers you if your car damages someone else's property. Usually it is their car, but it could be a fence, a house or any other property damaged in an accident. It also provides you with legal defense if another party files a lawsuit against you. It is a good idea to purchase enough of this insurance to cover the amount of damage your car might do to another vehicle or object. Coverage is limited to the terms and conditions contained in the policy.\n\nFIRST PARTY MEDICAL BENEFITS\nFirst Party Benefits cover several areas of insurance coverage; however, this definition is for First Party Benefits-Medical. Similar to medical payments coverage and Personal Injury Protection, FPB helps pay for your medical expenses if you or relatives living in your household are injured in an accident. Specific limits and coverages vary by state, but typically these services include:\n\n- Related medical and surgical treatment\n- Essential rehabilitative services (physical therapy, speech pathology, etc.)\n- Necessary dental, psychiatric, psychological, and optometric treatment\n- Ambulance and nursing service\n- Required medications, medical supplies, and prosthetic devices\n\nTHRESHOLD LIMIT\nUnder some no-fault insurance laws, the threshold level represents the degree of injury a claimant must establish before being allowed to sue the negligent party. The threshold may be verbal (regarding the severity of the injuries) or a dollar amount ($10,000), or both. For example, with a threshold of $5,000, an injured person may sue if his/her injuries and other economic damages (rehabilitation expenses, loss of income, etc.) exceed $5,000.\n\nPersonal Umbrella Liability Ex:\n- Annual Coverage\n- Cap Coverage\n- Each Accident / Per Accident\n- Each Occurrence / Per Occurrence\n- Each Person / Per Person\n\nRenters Ex:\n- Actual Cash Value\n- Bodily Injury\n- Per Occurrence\n- Property Damage\n\nwhere:\n\nACTUAL CASH VALUE\nIn many states, this means that in the event of a covered loss, you'll be paid the current replacement cost of whatever you lost, minus depreciation. (This generally includes the estimated wear and tear on the item damaged or the loss in value of that item because of aging and use). The total amount you'd be paid would be subject to the terms of your particular policy, including applicable deductible and coverage limits.\n\nWorkers' Compensation Ex:\n- Bodily Injury By Accident Each Accident\n- Bodily Injury By Disease Each Employee\n- Bodily Injury By Disease Policy Limit",
