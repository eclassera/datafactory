For example, you would file an appeal if Medicare doesn't pay or doesn't pay enough for a service you got, you don't get, or an item or service you think you should get. This complaint is made to your Medicare health plan or the Original Medicare Plan. There is usually a special process you must use to make your complaint.\n\nThe process you use if you disagree with any decision about your health care services. If Medicare does not pay for an item or service you have been given, or if you are not given an item or service you think you should get, you can have the initial Medicare decision reviewed again.
