		"Description": "The proceeds from life insurance policies can be paid in many ways dependent upon the choice of the policyowner or the beneficiary.\n\nThere are five settlement options available:\n-  Lump-Sum Cash Option\n-  Interest-Only Option\n-  Fixed Period Option\n-  Life Income Options\n-  Fixed Amount Option\n\nLUMP-SUM CASH OPTION\nAll policy proceeds are to be paid in a single lump-sum cash settlement.\n\nINTEREST-ONLY OPTION\nThe insurance company holds the proceeds for a specified period and at regular intervals pays the beneficiary a guaranteed rate on the proceeds.   The proceeds themselves are paid at the end of the specified period in cash or under one of the settlement options.\n\nFIXED PERIOD OPTION\nThe insurance company pays the beneficiary equal amounts of money at regular intervals over a specific period.   This option in effect pays out principal and interest earned.    The amount of each installment payment is determined upon the length of the desired period of income.   The longer the period of income the smaller each payment will be.   Conversely, the shorter the period, the larger each payment will be.\n\nLIFE INCOME OPTIONS\nThere are many forms of Life Income Option in which the beneficiary receives a guaranteed income for life no matter how long he or she lives.   The principal and interest are paid together and calculated to guarantee a lifetime.    Should the   principal be used up, the   income payments will continue as long as the   beneficiary lives.    \n\nLife Income Settlement Options:\n- Cash Refund Option\n- Installment Refund Option\n- Joint And Survivor Option\n- Life With Period Certain Option\n- Period Certain Option\n- Straight Life Income Option\n\nFIXED AMOUNT OPTION\nThe   policy proceeds plus interest are used to pay out a specified amount of income at regular intervals as long the   proceeds allow.   The   amount of each income payment is fixed with the   period depending upon the   payment amount.    Excess interest is credited and extends the   payment period with the   payments remaining the   same.",
