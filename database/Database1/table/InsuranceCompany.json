An employer without an identification number must apply for one using Form SS-4 (Application for Employer Identification Number). \nAn employer should have one identification number. An employer who has more than one number and is not sure which number to use should check with the IRS Center where his returns are filed. When contacting the IRS concerning the numbers, the employer should be prepared to provide the numbers he has, the name and address to which each is assigned, and the address of his main place of business. \nIf an employer took over another employer's business, the number of the employer whose business was taken over should not be used by the one taking over the business. If the employer taking over the business does not have an employer identification number by the time a return is due, \"Applied for\" and the date the number was applied for should be written in the space provided for the number.",
