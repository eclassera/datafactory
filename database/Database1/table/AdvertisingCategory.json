		"Description": "A classification of the objectives or focus of an Advertising Campaign or Advertising Event based upon common characteristics, objectives or message.\n\nEx:\n\nADVOCACY ADVERTISING\n Advertising used to promote a position on a political, controversial or other social issue.\n \nBUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS ADVERTISING\n Advertising directed to other businesses, rather than to consumers.\n \nCLASSIFIED ADVERTISING\n Print advertising that is limited to certain classes of goods and services, and usually limited in size and content.\n \nCOMMERCIAL ADVERTISING\n Advertising that involves commercial interests rather than advocating a social or political cause.\n \nCOMPARATIVE ADVERTISING\n An advertising appeal that consists of explicitly comparing one product brand to a competitive brand.\n \nCONSUMER ADVERTISING\n Advertising directed at a person who will actually use the product for their own benefit, rather than to a business or dealer.\n \nCONTINUOUS ADVERTISING\n Promotional efforts designed to stimulate short-term purchasing behavior. Coupons, premiums, and samples are examples of consumer stimulants.\n \nCORPORATE ADVERTISING\n A campaign that promotes a corporation, rather than a product or service sold by that corporation.\n \nCORRECTIVE ADVERTISING\n Advertisements or messages within advertisements, that the Federal Trade Commission orders a company to run, for the purpose of correcting consumers' mistaken impressions created by prior advertising.\n \nCOUNTER ADVERTISING\n Advertising that takes a position contrary to an advertising message that preceded it. Such advertising may be used to take an opposing position on a controversial topic, or to counter an impression that might be made by another party's advertising.\n \nDIRECTORY ADVERTISING\n Advertising that appears in a directory (telephone directory, tourism brochure, etc.). This frequently connotes advertising that consumers intentionally seek.\n \nDISPLAY ADVERTISING\n (1) In print media, any advertisement other than a classified ad. (2) An ad that stands alone, such as window sign.\n \nGREEN ADVERTISING\n Advertising that promotes a product or service's ability to help or, more likely, not hurt the environment.\n \nIMAGE ADVERTISING\n Promoting the image, or general perception, of a product or service, rather than promoting its functional attributes. Commonly used for differentiating brands of parity products (e.g., \"This is a woman's cigarette\").\n \nINDUSTRIAL ADVERTISING\n A form of business-to-business advertising (see above), this is advertising aimed at manufacturers. This advertising typically promotes parts, equipment, and raw materials used in the manufacturing process.\n \nINSTITUTIONAL ADVERTISING\n Advertising to promote an institution or organization, rather than a product or service, in order to create public support and goodwill.\n \nMAIL-ORDER ADVERTISING\n Advertising which supplies paperwork for the purpose of soliciting a purchase made through the mail.\n \nNARROWCAST ADVERTISING\n Using a broadcast medium to appeal to audiences with special interests. For example, the \"All Knitting Station\" would be a narrowcast, because it appeals to an audience with a specific interest.\n \nNONCOMMERCIAL ADVERTISING\n Radio and television advertising that is designed to educate and promote ideas or institutions, e.g., public service announcements.\n \nOUTDOOR ADVERTISING\n Any outdoor sign that publicly promotes a product or service, such as billboards, movie kiosks, etc.\n \nPUBLIC RELATIONS ADVERTISING\n Advertising by a corporation that focuses on public interest but maintains a relationship to the corporation's products or agencies.\n \nPUBLIC SERVICE ADVERTISING (PSA)\n Advertising with a central focus on public welfare, and is generally sponsored by a non-profit institution, civic group, religious organization, trade association, or political group.\n \nSPECIALTY ADVERTISING\n This is the older term used for Promotional products (see above). It remains a commonly used term by many companies.\n \nTRADE ADVERTISING\n Advertising designed to increase sales specifically for retailers and wholesalers.\n \nTRANSIT ADVERTISING\n Advertising that appears on public transportation or on waiting areas and bus stops.",
