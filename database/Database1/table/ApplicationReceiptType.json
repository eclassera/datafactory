A binding receipt typically specifies a maximum amount that would be payable during the protection period.\n\nTypically:\n- The applicant is covered at the time of application for amount of insurance that was applied for but not to exceed a certain amount. The temporary coverage continues until the policy is issued or until the company rejects the applicant but in no event for more than a specific period of time from when the agreement was signed.\n\n- Should a medical examination be required, the temporary insurance coverage does not begin until the examination has been completed. If death accidentally occurs with a specific period of time from the date of the agreement, the death benefit is paid even though the medical examination has not taken place.\n\n- The applicant for insurance must pay in advance at least a specific premium for the policy being applied for. There must also be no misrepresentations in the application and the death must not be the result of suicide.\n\nCONDITIONAL RECEIPT\nThis is the most common type of premium receipt in which certain conditions must be met in order for insurance coverage to go into effect.\n\nThe insurer conditionally assumes the risk and will provide coverage from the specified date on the condition that the applicant is approved for policy issuance.\n\nThere are two types of conditional receipts:\n- Approved Receipt\n- Insurability Receipt\n\n1) APPROVED RECEIPT\nCoverage is effective if and only after the application has been approved by the insurance company.\n\n2) INSURABILITY RECEIPT\nThis type of receipt provides that coverage is effective when the applicant pays the initial premium on condition that the applicant proves to be insurable, which is either on the date that the application is signed or the date of the medical exam. If the applicant proves to be uninsurable as of the application date or of the medical exam, then no coverage takes effect and the premium is returned.",
