The premium rate is based on the attained age of the insured at the time the paid-up additions are purchased.\n\nPurchase One-Year Term Insurance:\nDividends can be used to purchase as much one-year term insurance as possible or to purchase one-year term insurance equal to the base policy's cash value.
